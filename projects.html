        <dt><strong>RFID Based Library Management System</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Description:<br> Designed and implemented an RFID-based library management system using the Arduino Uno
                microcontroller, integrating hardware components and software functionalities to automate library
                operations and enhance efficiency.<br>
                Tech Stack:<br> Embedded C/C++, Arduino UNO.<br>
                Key Features:<br> Automates book identification and tracking, improves efficiency in storage and retrieval
                operations.<br>
                Role & Responsibilities:<br>
                1. Led the design and architecture of the library management system, defining hardware requirements,
                sensor placements, and software modules.<br>
                2. Integrated RFID technology for book identification and tracking.<br>
                3. Developed software components using Embedded C/C++ to interface with RFID readers and the Arduino Uno
                microcontroller<br>
